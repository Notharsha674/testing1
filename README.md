# Fun Interactive Enhancements

This repo contains a small interactive demo (HTML + CSS + JS) that makes a simple webpage more fun to interact with.

Features
- Theme toggle (light/dark)
- Points system with a visible counter
- Mini quiz with immediate feedback and badge reward
- Progress bar that updates as you answer questions
- Drag-and-drop cards (gain points when dropping)
- "Surprise Me" button that triggers a confetti animation and sound
- Accessible focus styles and ARIA-friendly updates

How to use locally
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Notharsha674/testing1.git
2. Copy the four files (index.html, style.css, script.js, README.md) into the repo root (or desired folder).
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.

Deploy
- You can serve this using GitHub Pages by enabling Pages in the repository settings and selecting the branch where `index.html` is stored.
- Or use any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc).

Ideas to extend
- Add more quiz questions and store progress in localStorage.
- Add user profiles, persistent badges, and shareable achievement links.
- Add levels and time-based challenges.
- Add microinteractions (subtle vibrations on mobile, sound effects, animated SVG icons).
- Integrate a simple chatbot or hints system (small AI/FAQ).

If you want, I can:
- Add these files to the repository for you.
- Open a PR with the changes.
- Break the work into smaller issues so contributors can pick them up.
